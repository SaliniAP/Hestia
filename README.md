Challenge: Adolescent Mental Health  

Teenage mental health has been a growing concern over the past few years and has accelerated with the pandemic. To address this, we reflected back onto our own teenage years and asked ourselves what we could have benefited from growing up. As a result, we have Hesta! A mental health web-app that allows users to take care of a planet as if it was tamagotchi. By accomplishing tasks off your to-do list and creating journal entries, your planet grows healthier with new features added. 

This is a prototype build to demonstrate our core ideas. 

🛠 *How does it work?*  
Add items to your to-do list and as you cross them off, watch flowers bloom on your planet! Creating journal entries allows for different features to grow on the planet such as rivers. 

🧠 *How does this help?*  
The web-app incentives the user to do basic chores they've been meaning to get to in order to see their planet thrive. Writing journal entries helps the user take stuff off their mind with the same incentive of seeing your planet thrive. Combined, being able to take care of your planet translates to showing the user they can take care of themselves as well. Little rewards provide a lot of benefit to those struggling and seeing your planet's health can be a good visual indicator to how your life is doing.

🕹️ *What is it built with?*  
We built this using Python 3 (specifically 3.11). The main packages we used are Panadas and StreamLit. 

🌔 *Where does the name Hestia come from?*  
Following the naming scheme of planets in our solar system, we chose Hestia as it also represented the Greek goddess of the home and hearth. That is the feeling we wanted to emulate with our app.  

🤖 *What is the future of this project?*  
As stated, this program is a prototype created for ElleHacks meant to showcase our core ideas. Periodically, this may be updated to fix bugs.

👾 *AI Notice*  
The code to build the web-app was partially written by AI, specifically ChatGPT. ChatGPT was also consulted for information on building the program.
