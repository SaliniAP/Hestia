Challenge: Adolescent Mental Health 

Teenage mental health has been a growing concern over the past few years and has excellerated with the pandemic. To adsdress this, we reflected back onto our own teenage years and asked ourselves what we could have benefitedfrom growing up. As a result, we have Hesta! A mental health web-app that allows users to take care of a planet as if it was tamagotchi. By accomplishing tasks off your to-do list and creating journal entries, your planet grows healthier with new features added. 

This is a prototype build to demonstrate our core ideas.
